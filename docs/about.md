# About

Welcome to the NBIS Book Club! This is a shared collection of books held by NBIS staff.

The NBIS Book Club aims to promote knowledge sharing and foster a culture of reading among our members through a collection of books covering academic books to fiction and light reading.

Members can contribute books to the collection and track who currently has each book. The collection is maintained in a shared spreadsheet and displayed here for easy browsing.

## Usage
### Browsing

You can browse the collection by filtering and sorting based on various fields such as language, owner, and location. Click on a book cover to view more details about the book, including its description, owner, and location. Borrowed books are indicated with a red border and the text "Borrowed by ...".

### Add a book

- If you'd like to add a book, please fill out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/L6zKC9wUjdgnVFfD9).

### Borrow a book

- To borrow a book, contact the owner directly through Slack or email and decide on how to facilitate the borrowing.

- To mark a book as borrowed, go to the Google Sheet linked in the navigation bar and fill in the 'Borrowed' field with your name.

## Tips

- You will need an nbis.se or scilifelab.se email address to access the form and sheet.

- To find book information based on ISBN ID, use [Bookfinder](https://www.bookfinder.com/) or [WorldCat](https://search.worldcat.org/) for example.

- If you have a large book collection at home that you would like to catalogue, you can use an App like [HandyLib](https://www.handylibrary.com/) for example to scan the barcodes and export an Excel/CSV file that can be adapted for bulk upload to the Google Sheets.
